# Longevity Training PWA 🧠💪

A minimalist Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to improve **VO₂ Max, strength, mobility, and long-term health**, inspired by the principles of *Outlive* by **Peter Attia**.

This app is built for people who want to **age slower, move better, and live longer** — without spending hours in the gym.

## 🌱 Philosophy

> We are not training for aesthetics.  
> We are training for **healthspan**.

Longevity Training is based on four pillars:
- **Zone 2 aerobic base**
- **VO₂ Max (high-intensity intervals)**
- **Strength training**
- **Mobility, balance & play**

The goal is to build a resilient body that stays capable and independent well into old age.
